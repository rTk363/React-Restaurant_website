# Deploying The Site:

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
  
  
 ## Download the contents of the [json-server File](https://github.com/rTk363/React-Restaurant_website/tree/main/json-server) on your system
 
  Then open your terminal in the json-server folder and write:
  ### `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000`
  
  #### Note: You need to launch the temporary json-server file first in order to run the Site.
